# Movie Globe (Front)- Final project on Technigo Bootcamp Spring 2023 by Jonas Jakobson and Vera Sjunnesson
The Movie Globe allows you to delve into the world of movies through an engaging and interactive map experience. Simply scroll the map, click on a location, and uncover valuable information about the films shot there. While the app comes with a set of initial movies, registering as a user grants you access to a more extensive movie collection, along with the ability to contribute your own favorite locations. On your personal page, you'll find a curated list of the movies you've liked, as well as a space to add your own comments.

Let Movie Globe take you on a cinematic journey that expands your geographical conception of movies, transporting you to extraordinary locations where the magic of cinema comes alive!

## The build
The Movie Globe was built with JavaScript using React and Redux, with the interactive map feature powered by React-Leaflet. React-Leaflet is a popular library that seamlessly integrates Leaflet, a JavaScript mapping library, with React components, allowing for the creation of interactive and visually appealing maps within the application. Other packages and dependencies include:
React-router-dom
@reduxjs/toolkit
@mui-material
Styled-components
@lottiefiles
react-material-ui-carousel
